# Car Check v1.0

A simple html page that uses iframe to show two separate web pages in one. This is useful so instead of going to 2 different webpages you can toggle between the two pages in one window. 

Its extreamely useful if you are looking to buy a used car.

Initially I was going to include a motor insurance validation check. But decided not to due to the terms of usage.
